# twitch-fuckery

A custom twitch chat widget that allows cool emotes to show up in the on-stream chat widget based on text replacement whether or not twitch approves.

### Initial goals

* use an emote on a twitch stream that twitch denied citing "vulgar gestures" (at least in the on-stream chat)
* use it in such a way that is only vulgar toward those that have earned it (users banned and messages deleted/flagged by mods)
* more in-chat hype generated around channel point redemption
